These are the images that I used to try out the accuracy of the model IRL. They were cherry-picked in the sense that all categories are somewhat represented, without having trained the model on the specific images.

The names define the label of the image: "c" means cotton, "k(n)" means KN95, "m" medical, "f" and "ff0" shield, and "ff" gas. Feel free to try your own, and reach out for any findings or suggestions. 

Only two out of these were mistakenly classified by the model, though with low confidence and mostly due to wrong data labeling in the training set on my part. 

Live and learn, I suppose.
