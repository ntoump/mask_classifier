## THE APPLICATION IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE. GET IN TOUCH TO LEARN MORE.

### This version of the application is OBSOLETE. Head over to https://protected-mountain-28715.herokuapp.com/ to experiment with the freely available newer version (Mask Classifier v3).

This is the Mask Classifier (v2). 

It was build as a project of https://fast.ai course v4, and it uses many high-level levers of the fastai2 library. For that, one can only be thankful to its creators.

You may find information about the model and its training while running the Binder application. Thank you for it checking out.


Regarding how I got here:
I have dedicated about a week collecting and cleaning data, training different models, and creating these explanatory labels for human consumption. Most of my time, however, was dedicated in getting things to actually work; I used Voila and Binder, and it was suprisingly difficult to get them up and running as they are supposed to.

My advice for any novices, being one of them, is to not give up. Always be tenacious and consistent. Reach out when you need help and Google, being your friend, will have 
something in store for you. 

A huge shoutout to all those who have made it easy to understand deep learning and use it to produce value.
